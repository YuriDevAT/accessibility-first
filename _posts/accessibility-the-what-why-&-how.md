Web accessibility has fortunately been getting more and more attention lately. But many people still don’t know what web accessibility actually is and why it’s so important.

Let’s get an overall understanding on accessibility by introducing you to this topic in the context of the **what**, **why** and **how**: what accessibility is, why it’s important and how we can achieve accessible design.


## What is accessibility

Regarding to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility),

>Web accessibility is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, more users have equal access to information and functionality.

There are all kinds of disabilities, some are recognizable, like people who are in wheelchairs, and others are hidden, like people who are deaf. There are also age-related disabilities like hearing loss or low vision, and temporary disabilities like having a broken arm or even holding a baby.

You may have seen the hashtag **#a11y**, which is the short version of the word accessibility. The reason for this shortening is that there are 11 characters between the letter “a” and the letter “y”. In my opinion, this is a cool way to shorten a word and much easier to use as a hashtag.
