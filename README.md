## Report a bug 🐛

Thank you for taking part in making this website accessible. I am doing my best to make this website as accessible as possible. As I maintain this website on my own, it takes time to fix these issues, so please be patient with me.

Please make sure that the problem has not already been reported before you raise it. I am happy to hear about any accessibility issues you find.
